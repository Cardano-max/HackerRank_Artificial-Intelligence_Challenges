# HackerRank_Artificial-Intelligence_Challenges
I know that there is a lot of people who are interested in AI, but they have no idea how to start learning it. I'm here to make things easier for them.  I have tried to help learning community by Solving Artificial intelligence challenges on Hacker Rank and to put scripting along with explanation of each code so that others can learn code and grow.  I am sharing my solution to each challenge in the form of a script which has been written using Python language along with explanation. The script is also available in Jupyter Notebook format, so that you can run it on your local machine as well.
